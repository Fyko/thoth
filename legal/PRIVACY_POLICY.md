Thoth does not collect or store any message content from your Discord server. Our bot activates only in response to specific commands or scheduled tasks (such as Word of The Day) initiated by users.

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Thoth! We take your privacy seriously and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy outlines our practices concerning the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you use the Thoth Discord Bot.

## 2. Information Collection

When Thoth is added to or removed from a server, we log this event permanently to maintain a history of our service reach and for security purposes.

For each command executed through Thoth, we log the command, the user ID that executed it, and any provided arguments. These logs are permanent and are critical for identifying and mitigating abuse of our service and for enhancing the botâ€™s functionalities.

When you register for the Word of the Day feature, Thoth creates a Discord webhook and a corresponding database record. Should this webhook be deleted, Thoth will automatically remove the associated record upon the next attempted delivery.

## 3. No Message Content Collection

Thoth does not collect or store any message content from your Discord server. Our bot activates only in response to specific commands initiated by users.

## 4. Use of Information

The information we collect is solely for the purpose of providing the service, preventing abuse, and improving our bot features.

## 5. Data Retention

We retain logs of bot addition/removal and command execution permanently for the reasons stated above.
